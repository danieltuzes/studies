"""random_test.py
    This file provides 3 tests for a random number generator
    and checks for some basic quality property on the engine.
    It is not aimed to provide a deep analysis but to come
    up with some ideas that are easy to implement and interpret.

    # Test 1:
    Create two arrays A and B as vectors with 1-1 million of random numbers
    generated with the prng with adjacent seeds. The average of such arrays
    tends to 0 with increasing size, but for a fixed length of 1 million,
    it will have a non-0 average. Substract the average then calculate
    the scalar product of the vectors as function of the shift of values in B,
    i.e. let C a vector for which
    C[i] = Î£_j A[j] * B[j-i]
    and then plot C[i] as a function of i in the range [-200:200].
        * This should be a random noise with values around 0. The fact
          that it is around 0 is a consequence of the operation
          subtracting the average.
        * Its cumulative distribution at C[0] must tend to be 0.5 showing
          that the same amount of numbers are smaller than 0 than larger
          than 0, i.e. the median tends to 0 if the average is 0.
        * Accumulating the values of C represent a non-binary
          random walk, and it should not tend to 0 with increasing
          length of A or C.

    # Test 2:
    Create list of lists A[i], i=0:10, where each list has L random numbers
    generated with the prng with adjacent seeds. The size of the array
    will increase and we check how a property scales with increasing size.
    Then calculate the correlation matrix C for every i, j in 0:10
    C[i][j] = pearson_correlation(A[i], A[j])
    C is a matrix with a size of 10 x 10. Calculate the eigenvalues of C.
    If the length L of A[i] is smaller than 10, it will be a degenrate matrix,
    and not more than L eigenvalue will be relevant, but if L>10, we have
    10 eigenvalues. The largest eigenvalues must tend to 1 with
    increasing L. Plot the eigenvalues as a function of increasing L and be
    sure it tends to 1.

    # Test 3
    Generete 1'000'000 random numbers with the prng using seed 0 into A.
    Then check what is the longest sequence from the end of the array
    that can be found in the array. A[-2:-1] is a sequence of 1 number,
    this can be found at the end of A, and if the numbers are represented
    with 64 bit precision, there is a chance of P1 = 1 - (1-(1/2^64))^1'000'000
    that this number is repeated, P = 5 * 10^-14. Because this propability
    is very low, most propably even the last element cannot be found again,
    and there is no real need to check for a 2-long sequence.
    I also implemented the test of the uniquness of the fist few numbers.

    # Test 4
    The average of random numbers generated from one seed tends to 0.5, as well
    as the average of the first random number from increasing seed values."""
